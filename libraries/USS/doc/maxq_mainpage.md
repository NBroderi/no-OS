# MAXQ API Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the MAXQ APIs. This documentation provides an overview and detailed descriptions of the necessary functions to work with the MAXQ1065 and MAXQ1080 microcontrollers.

## Overview
The MAXQ APIs offer a comprehensive set of functions for interacting with the MAXQ1065 and MAXQ1080 microcontrollers. These functions include cryptographic operations, object management, and various other utilities to facilitate secure and efficient operation.

## Key Features
- **Cryptographic Functionality**: Perform secure cryptographic operations including encryption, decryption, hashing, and digital signatures.
- **Object Management**: Manage cryptographic objects, including key creation, storage, and deletion.
- **Secure Communication**: Establish and maintain secure communication channels.
- **Platform Independence**: Consistent API behavior across different hardware platforms.

## Modules
The MAXQ API is divided into several modules, each responsible for different aspects of functionality:

- **Cryptographic Operations**: Functions for encryption, decryption, hashing, and digital signatures.
- **Object Management**: Functions for creating, storing, and managing cryptographic objects.
- **Secure Communication**: Functions for establishing secure communication channels.
- **Utilities**: Various helper functions to support other operations.
